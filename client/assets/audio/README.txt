IMPORTANT: Custom Game Announcer Audio
========================================

This directory (`client/assets/audio/`) is used to host custom MP3 files for the game's praise system.
If you place MP3 files here with the specific filenames below, the game will play them instead of using the computer's Text-to-Speech voice.

Supported Filenames:
--------------------
1. perfect.mp3
2. excellent.mp3
3. unbelievable.mp3
4. great.mp3
5. outstanding.mp3

Instructions:
-------------
1. Download a "Game Announcer" sound pack (e.g., from Quake 3, Unreal Tournament, or Halo).
2. Rename the files to match the list above (must be lowercase .mp3).
3. Place them in this folder.
4. Refresh the game. The system will automatically detect and play them.

If a file is missing, the game will automatically fallback to the default Robot Voice (TTS).
